Pandas is great, but it's a little persnickety about knowing how data is separated into cells in the document we're loading up, so we (2) set the separator paramter to ',' to basically indicate that we want commas to separate our different datasets. Cool. Lastly, taking a quick look at our data, you'll notice that there's a space before every word and number followed by a column. That space? Not very useful. So we edit it out with (3) setting the parameter for skipinitialspace to \"True\".\n",

If your document already has headers, feel free to leave this variable out--Pandas will infer what the names are by simply look at the first row in your data sheet and saying \"Ah! these are the headers!\" But if you don't have headers, you'll need to (a) build a list of headers yourself and (b) tell pandas to use that list as headers, like so . . .\n"
